##Wet Ingredients
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup packed light-brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs


##Dry Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 cups (about 12 ounces) semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips
- Lots of gluten!


##Cooking Directions
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
- In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside.
- In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine
  the butter with both sugars; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy.
- Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla, and eggs. Beat until well mixed,
  about 1 minute.
- Add flour mixture; mix until just combined.
- Stir in the chocolate chips.

- Drop heaping tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking
  sheets lined with parchment paper.
- Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center,
  8 to 10 minutes.
- Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes.
- Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.

##Storage Directions
- Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.
